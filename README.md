# project-1

# Description
This was collaborative effort to make a trip planning app. Given a destination and time of stay, the app will generate a selection of 4 hotels for the user to choose from. After the choice is made, the app will generate a list of restaurants and attractions the user can cycle through and add to their day by day itinerary. Trips can be edited, saved, and accessed for later use!

# Features
- Day to day planning! Each day of the itinerary is unique, and we let you know what the distance and duration of your journey between your locations are! Plan everything down to the minutes!
- Save/Load functionality! With password protection!
- Trip optimization! Want to know what is the most efficient way to get around? We can optimize that for you!

# Limitations/Issues
- The trips that can be planned are limited by what Yelp has on their database, which can be surprisingly limiting. (Upon some testing, some Central American cities, China, Russia... Antartica.) The API will always do its best to fill your search instead of returning a bad request, so you might no always end up where you thought you wanted to go. (i.e. Moscow takes you to a middle of nowhere town in Oregon.)
